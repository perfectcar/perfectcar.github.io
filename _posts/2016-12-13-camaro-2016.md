Aerodynamically chiseled to perfection

The lessons of extensive wind tunnel testing hours can be found chiseled across the redesigned Camaro sports car. From the wider opening and precise draft angle of the grille, to the roof’s striking “reverse mohawk” channel, to the lift-reducing stanchion spoiler, the design of every surface and edge was scrutinized until it helped improve airflow and performance.
